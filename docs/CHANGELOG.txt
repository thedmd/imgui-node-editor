v0.9.1 (WIP):

    CHANGE: Remove unwanted extra frame height from node bottom

    CHANGE: Allow to specify if links of deleted node should also be automatically deleted
        Now it is possible to delete only node without automatically serving links,
        application can choose to do this operation by itself and for example
        short circuit flow links ot do any other special operation.

    CHANGE: Canvas: Allow to overlap canvas widget

    CHANGE: Natvis: Move crude_json natvis to separate file

    CHANGE: Natvis: Show readable NodeId/PinId/LinkId

    CHANGE: Make Navigate action to honor duration

    CHANGE: Travis: Use Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) for CI, to get newer version of GLFW3

    CHANGE: Editor: Make action button internally configurable

    CHANGE: Make Node Editor forward compatible with ImGui 1.80+ (#112)
        We're keeping backward compatibility with pre 1.8x versions.

    NEW: All source components are now versioned

    NEW: Make view state independent of window resolution.

    NEW: Editor can now break links connected specified node or pin
        New API:
        int BreakLinks(NodeId nodeId);
        int BreakLinks(PinId pinId);

    NEW: Editor can now tell if node or pin has any links attached
        New API:
        bool HasAnyLinks(NodeId nodeId);
        bool HasAnyLinks(PinId pinId);

    NEW: Editor can be queried if particular node or link is selected
        New API:
        bool IsNodeSelected(NodeId nodeId);
        bool IsLinkSelected(LinkId linkId);

    NEW: Editor now can return pins of the link
        New API:
        bool GetLinkPins(LinkId linkId, PinId* startPinId, PinId* endPinId);

        `startPinId` and `endPinId` may be null if caller is not interested
        in particular id.

    NEW: Editor now return ids of hovered node/pin/link
        New API:
        NodeId GetHoveredNode();
        PinId GetHoveredPin();
        LinkId GetHoveredLink();

    NEW: Add SetGroupSize() to explicitly set group size
        New API:
        void SetGroupSize(NodeId nodeId, const ImVec2& size);

    NEW: crude_json: Add save() and load()

        When CRUDE_JSON_IO == 1 value will have load() and save()
        function implemented using stdio.h FILE.

    NEW: crude_json: Add erase() and get_ptr()

    NEW: Application overhaul
        - Convert from function based to inheritable class
        - Add ability to close app and change title from code
        - Add ability to control main window flags (ex. show menubar)
        - Save ImGui state to ini file
        - Render using pre-multiplied alpha textures
        - Add extra fonts to examples.

    NEW: Reintegrate Widgets example from @crolando (#77)

    NEW: User can now override button indices for various actions (#88)
        New API in Config:
            int                     DragButtonIndex;        // Mouse button index drag action will react to (0-left, 1-right, 2-middle)
            int                     SelectButtonIndex;      // Mouse button index select action will react to (0-left, 1-right, 2-middle)
            int                     NavigateButtonIndex;    // Mouse button index navigate action will react to (0-left, 1-right, 2-middle)
            int                     ContextMenuButtonIndex; // Mouse button index context menu action will react to (0-left, 1-right, 2-middle)

    NEW: Flow direction can now be picked per flow (#104)
        New API:
            enum class FlowDirection
            {
                Forward,
                Backward
            };

            void Flow(LinkId linkId, FlowDirection direction = FlowDirection::Forward);

    BUGFIX: Avoid crash while destroying editor.

    BUGFIX: Save draw list used by editor between Begin() and End()
        There is a chance ImGui::GetWindowDrawList() will return different draw list
        while nodes are being composed. To avoid troubles of manipulating incorrect
        draw list one obtained in Begin() is remembered and used.

    BUGFIX: Avoid division by zero in ImCubicBezierBoundingRect

    BUGFIX: Don't stuck in delete action if user does not handle it

    BUGFIX: Enable use channel splitter inside Begin/End for node and pin. #28

    BUGFIX: Don't manipulate channels when editor is suspended #28

    BUGFIX: Fix ObjectId serialization

    BUGFIX: GroupNode resize instead of move on low zoom #87

    BUGFIX: Make Canvas work with Viewports (#91, #90)

    BUGFIX: Explicitly choose embedded GL3W as OpenGL extension loader (#96)

    BUGFIX: Application: Don't apply HiDPI logic for (-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX) mouse position

    BUGFIX: Editor: Clamp over-the-edge drag distance to prevent scrolling to infinity on focus lost

    BUGFIX: Editor: Consume scroll event (#73) (require ImGui 17909 or later)

    BUGFIX: Editor: Respect window focus while handling actions (#99)

    BUGFIX: Examples: Correct case of `data` directory (#97)

    BUGFIX: Canvas: Save/Restore CursorMaxPos only in Begin/End (#101)

    BUGFIX: Editor: Don't implicitly capture keyboard (#83)

    BUGFIX: Application: Reset key down state after loosing keyboard focus

    BUGFIX: Editor: Make off-screen dragging work again

    BUGFIX: ImGui: Disable obsolete functions (#103)
